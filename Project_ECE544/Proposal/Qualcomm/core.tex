{\bf $\blacksquare$ RF Front End:}
In this module, we have three transmitter-receiver pairs, one for each frequency band. Functionally, all the three pairs are equivalent.
The transmitter emits an FMCW signal with an omnidrectional antenna pattern, and the corresponding receiver receives the reflected signals using a multi-armed beam pattern (Fig.~\ref{fig:beam1}). The antenna parameters for generating the multi-armed beam are provided by the \texttt{Sublinear Imaging} module.  %For instance, with the beam pattern in Fig.?, the receiver can capture reflections from $60^\circ$, $20^\circ$, $180^\circ$ and $120^\circ$.
The received signal is then passed on to the \texttt{Sublinear Imaging} module.


%We collect $M$ number of measurements at the receiver using $M$ distinct beam patterns, and these measurements are passed to the \texttt{Sublinear Imaging Algorithm module} for further processing.


%by randomizing the set of directions that fall into the multi-armed beam pattern. 

%These $M$ measurements are fed into the \texttt{Sublinear Imaging Algorithm module} for further processing.% where each measurement comprises of the transmitted and received FMCW signal along with the corresponding multi-armed beam pattern, 


%The transmitted and received FMCW signal, along with the corresponding multi-armed beam pattern, are then fed into the Sublinear Imaging Algorithm for further processing.
