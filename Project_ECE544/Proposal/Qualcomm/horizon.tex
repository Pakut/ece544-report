\section{Project Horizon}
\vspace{-2mm}

We envision to complete this project within the next one year. First, we will converge on the algorithmic and design aspects of the system. Concurrently, we will also finalize the hardware platform with the phased-array antenna design to implement our sublinear imaging algorithm with multi-armed beams. We will conduct thorough experiments and testing, and consequently will deploy our testbed on vehicles to test our system in more practical settings.
